A clear smile of nature
As if they are turning green in rest.
Bee for a tribute to the field
Driven by the spring rays
Escaped by muddy streams
Flies out of the wax cell.
He meets the morning of the year through a dream;
I was already singing in the silence of the nights.
Still transparent, forests
The blue shines in the skies.
The valleys dry and dazzle;
The flocks are noisy, and the nightingale
There is already snow from the surrounding mountains
To the sunken meadows
